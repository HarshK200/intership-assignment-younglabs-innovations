To run the backend run `npm install` in the backend folder, followed by `node main.js`.

### Project structure:

The code is divided into two folders **frontend using react.js** and **backend for api using express.js**

    ├── backend/
    |   └── main.js
    |
    └── frontend/
        └── *(vite default project structure here)*

I've kept the backend in just a single file i.e. main.js to keep it simple since the project is very
small but for larger express.js projects i use the MVC pattern to keep the code clean, readable and
maintainable.

### Running the project:

**Backend:** To run the project start the backend express.js server using `node ./backend/main.js`
from the root of the project. (By default server starts on port 3000)

**Frontend:** To run react frontend run the command `npm run preview`
